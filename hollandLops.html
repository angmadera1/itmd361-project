      <p>Angie's Fun Farm is a small rabbitry located on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, and we currently
        breed Holland lops bunnies for show and pets. We strive to breed rabbits that conform to the ARBA Standard of
        Perfection
        and, most importantly, are gentle and cheerful.</p>
      <p> Our rabbitry raises our bunnies from birth. We give them plenty of social interaction with children and other
        pets,
        as well as plenty of love and attention. We treat all of the bunnies as a part of our family, and we hope that all
        rabbits
        we raise go to a pet home that will bring them so much joy and care.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in a bunny, please watch the video below to get a basic understanding of what it entails to

        <p>Mom: Brie x Dad: Chandler | Age: Three months old</p>
        <p>This buck would adjust well to a faster paced home with kids or relaxing on the floor in an adult household.
